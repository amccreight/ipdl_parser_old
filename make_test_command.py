# Test command generator for the IPDL parser.

# 1. Add the following code to ipc/ipdl/ipdl.py, do a build, and copy
# the output from the build, from INCLUDES to DONE, somewhere:
#
# print("INCLUDES")
# for i in includedirs:
#     print(i)
# print("FILES")
# for f in files:
#     print(f)
# print("DONE")
#
# 2. Adjust leading_text_example as necessary, if the log timestamp
# stuff has changed.
#
# 3. Run this script. You'll need to pass in the path your Firefox
# objdir as an argument, and pipe in the output from step 1. The
# objdir is needed to find IPDL files that have been preprocessed,
# such as PMediaTransport.ipdl. You can run the resulting command
# with bash or whatever.
